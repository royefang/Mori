# Mori

Mori is a memory game that tests an individual's short-term memory. This game
features an Arduino Uno, push buttons, and an RGB LED. The game flashes a string
of numbers from one to three (1-3) and gives the player a set amount of time to
memorize them. The string of numbers will be cleared from the screen and the player
will attempt to reproduce the aforementioned numbers using the push buttons.
